<h1 id="howdy-im-robert-">Howdy, I’m Robert 👋🤠</h1>

<p>I’m a computer science major at Northeastern University 🐾 . After taking various courses and spending nine months as a co-op with the Release Engineering 🏗  team at <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/">Wayfair</a>, I’ve become somewhat of a jack of all trades from code writing 📝  to shipment 🚢 . Most of my development experience has been in Python, but I am always open to learning new tools as a developer.</p>

<p>When I’m not groaning at Python code or CI/CD builds, I enjoy spending my time cooking 🥘 , scuffing up my joints on a skateboard 🛹 , or binge-consuming mechanical keyboard content ⌨️ .</p>
