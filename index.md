# Howdy, I'm Robert 👋🤠

I'm a computer science major at Northeastern University. After taking various courses and spending nine months as a co-op with the Release Engineering team at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com), I've become somewhat of a jack of all trades from code writing to shipment. Most of my development experience has been in Python, but I am always open to learning new tools as a developer.

When I'm not groaning at Python code or CI/CD builds, I enjoy spending my time cooking, scuffing up my joints on a skateboard, or binge-consuming mechanical keyboard content.

### Current Status 📍

* *Gearing up to join [Morse CORP](https://www.morsecorp.com) as a Python SWE co-op for the Spring 2022 semester*  🐉
* *Learning to become an emoji enthusiast, one emote at a time*  🦾
* *Scheming up a silly personal project with Docker and/or Python*  🐍 🐳
* *Completing the renovation of my [portfolio site](https://github.com/bobertoyin/bobertoyin.github.io) for the ~~third~~ fourth time*  📐
